# Introduction

This repo demonstrates how to write and test stories that call a form when there aren't any rules to activate/deactivate the form.

Note that the bot's policy uses `MemoizationPolicy` only.
# Usage

Run `make test` to run end-to-end test.
Run `make shell` to talk to the bot in the shell.
