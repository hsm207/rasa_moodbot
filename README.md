# Introduction

This repo shows how you can use rasa to create a bot that will proactively notify a user about an event e.g. the temperature is to high and allow the user to converse with the bot using that notification as a starting point.

# Usage
1. Open in a container in VS Code
2. Run `make run-bot`
3. Use the [restcalls](restcalls.http) script to simulate a conversation
